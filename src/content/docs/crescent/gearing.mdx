## Gearing in Occult Crescent
Each field operation features a new armor set that has its own unique set of effects specific for that field op's zone. In Occult Crescent, we have the ilvl 745 armor called **Arcanaut's Gear** and **Occult Accessories** which 
features main stat bonuses and a stat called "Special Attribute". 

**"Special Attribute" increases phantom action damage by ~1% per point.**

**Each piece of occult gear also receives +40/80/120 main stat.** Main stat increases your overall damage by a much more significant margin than other stat in the game. Always prioritize wearing Arcanaut's or 
Occult Accessories over trying to reach a certain stat tier or specific GCD.

### Melding your Gear
#### TL;DR - Don't! Materia affixed to gear higher than ilvl 700 is disabled in Occult Crescent.
In FFXIV, if a piece of gear's item level is above the duty's item level sync, then all materia on the gear will be disabled. This is consistent with every other duty in the game.

This means, while occult gear *can* be melded, you should not be meld it for specific use in Occult Crescent. The only gear that can be melded and have those melds *work* is Neo Kingdom gear.

## Where to Obtain Occult Gear
### Arcanaut's Armor
You can purchase all 7 sets of Arcanaut's gear from the Expedition Antiquarian in Base Camp for 4,000 Enlightened Silver pieces for each separate armor piece. There is no specific purchase order as each piece costs the same amount of silver
and provides an equal amount of bonus stats.
### Occult Accessories
These can be very rarely obtained from completing Critical Encounters, opening bronze/silver treasure coffers, and opening **gold** chests from either a Persistent Pot or Happy Bunnies (Fortune Carrots). 
#### Accessory Sources and Drop Rates
- **Earrings, Necklaces, and Bracelets** can only be obtained from Critical Encounters and treasure coffers around the South Horn. Specific CEs drop specific (non-ring) gear slots, either 'of Blood' or 'of Magic' at random. A map showcasing
which Critical Encounter drop what accessory is below.
  - CEs have a ~0.1% drop rate *(our best estimated value)*
  - Coffers have a ~0.06% drop rate.

## Occult Crescent Best-in-Slot
**Best in slot for all jobs would be wearing as much Arcanaut's gear and/or occult accessories as you can benefit from.** Both the main stat and special attribute bonuses provide the highest damage gain for minimal effort. 
The increased main stat will far, far outweigh any specific substat tiering or GCD speeds possible. Always try to prioritize wearing occult gear.

Special Attribute will increase phantom action damage by ~1% per point and the main stat bonus will give a similar ~1% damage bonus on your normal rotation for every +40 on a piece of gear. 

### Armor and Accessories
Wear as many pieces of Arcanaut's and Occult acceesories as you can reasonably obtain.

If you do not have a piece of Occult gear for a specific gear slot, fill it with the highest item level piece with desireable substats.

**True best in slot is wearing full Arcanaut's+2 and all 5 unique accessories for a total of +840 main stat and +21 special attribute.**

### Weapons
Phantom Weapons are generally the safest pick! They provide capped desireable substats at ilvl 700. There are some cases where another weapon may be better, 
but these differences are so minimal that its not worth worrying over. **A good rule of thumbs is to use the highest ilvl weapon with desirable stats.**

:::note[Special Attribute Weapons?]
There are currently no weapons with the Special Attribute on them.
:::

### Foods and Tinctures 
Both work in Occult Crescent! The current raid tier's consumables for your job/role. (e.g. 7.4 is Caramel Popcorn and Grade 4 Gemdraught). Note: Tinctures/Gemdraughts do not increase phantom action damage.

### What about Neo Kingdom?
Since occult gear now occupies every slot except for weapons and due to how powerful the gear's bonuses are, Neo Kingdom gear has been made irrelevant. If you're still working on getting your occult gear, 
neo kingdom can help you gain marginally small fractions \(\<1\%\) of damage gain, but its easier to just bring in the highest ilvl pieces with your role's preferred stats.
