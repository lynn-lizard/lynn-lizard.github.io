## What is the Forked Tower: Blood?
Forked Tower: Blood is the first iteration of high-end large-scale raiding content, that's normally seen in Field Ops, for the Occult Crescent. Inside this half of the tower are dangerous foes, hidden traps, fiendish bosses, and most importantly... LOOT! Namely Forked Tower allows players to complete their occult record books they've been keeping up with. As well as upgrade their Arcanaut's gear to the +2 version with Sanguinite, this raid's unique currency earned from chests all inside.

The raid consistent of multiple encounters some of which are bosses, others are more puzzle-like, or require players to traverse dangerous pathways. In order of appearance the raid plays out as follows:
1. Demon Tablet
2. Hallways
3. Dead Stars
4. Bridges
5. Marble Dragon
6. Lockwards
7. Magitaur

:::caution[Enraging Fights]
**Demon Tablet, Dead Stars, Bridges, Marble Dragon, and Magitaur** are all considered "enraging fights"
in which they must be completed within a certain timer; else the boss will enrage and kill the whole group. Forcing everyone to return out to base camp and re-level.
:::

Similar with Baldesian Aresenal in Eureka - being made to return out of Forked Tower while dead will force players to lose Knowledge XP and subsequently level down to 19. So be warned! This content is punishing! Though,
re-leveling is more tedious than anything. Getting back to level 20 requires doing at least 1 CE after patch 7.4's changes to XP loss on return. The biggest loss here is the time of waiting to re-enter Forked Tower.

<br/><hr/>
## Limited Raising and Lives
While in Forked Tower: Blood a Resurrection Restricted debuff will be placed on participants. This debuff starts at three stacks and act as your "lives" while inside the Forked Tower.
After you die and then accept a raise, you will lose one stack of debuff ( or "lifes/lives" here on). When reaching 1 life, dying, and accepting another raise - your 
Ressurection Restricted will turn into a Ressurection Denied.

From this point onwards, your next death is premanent. No method of raising can revive you and you are required to return out to Base Camp and causing you to level down. 
Don't worry though, getting back to level 20 is just 1 CE away (or gold farming a little bit).

The methods in which you can be raised are limited. So far, there are only two methods in which you can be raised are
1. Phantom Chemist with the Raise ability (unlocked at level 3)
2. Healer Limit Break 3.

Both methods will consume 1 life and the healer limit break 3 does **_not_** circumvent the resurrection denied status.

<br/><hr/>
## Required Phantom Jobs
The list of *actually mandatory* phantom jobs is really short. You just need a two time mages, thieves, bards, geomancers, and a single berserker for specific mechanics/sections. However, there are other jobs that aren't "required" but will definitely make
your experience much easier. In no particular order the following phantom jobs are strongly encouraged to be brought.
<details>
<summary>List and Explanation of Useful Phantom Jobs</summary>
- **Phantom Time Mage**:
A required phantom job to complete Forked Tower: Blood. Needed for dispelling specific adds at Demon Tablet, Bridges, and Lockwards. Can also slow a majority of adds throughout Forked Tower.

- **Phantom Geomancer**:
A required phantom job to complete Forked Tower: Blood. Uses Levitate to walk over hazards during Hallways and the Bridges encounter.

- **Phantom Bard**:
A required phantom job to complete Forked Tower: Blood. Helps increase a party's damage but noteably uses Romeo's Ballad to stun the Tower Idols during the Bridges encounter. If left unstunned,
the Idols will instantly wipe the group.

- **Phantom Thief**:
A required phantom job to complete Forked Tower: Blood. Percepts hidden traps and opens locked/hidden passages to help the group earn more Sanguinite. Also uses
Pilfer Weapon to remove a buff off an enemy during Lockwards.

- **Phantom Berserker**:
A required phantom job to complete Forked Tower: Blood. Used at Magitaur to kill the purple canister with their Rage ability to avoid being afflicted with Hysteria for 60 seconds.

- **Phantom Chemist**:
This is your only method of raising outside of Healer Limit Break 3. Progression groups are reccomended to bring a LOT of these for safety.

- **Phantom Knight**:
Provides a 10% damage mitigation for 30 minutes when using Pray near the knowledge crystal scattered throughout Forked Tower. Knights are also used to tank bosses, adds, and sometimes clear out
traps due to their Pledge ability. Noteably knights are great at taking the Marble Dragon "Dread Deluge" buster and the Magitaur Cannister's "Arcane Recoil".

- **Phantom Ranger**:
Can safely detonate/pop traps (hidden or visible) with Occult Falcon. Commonly used to pop the unstable/mega traps hidden throughout, especially on Bridges, so players can safely move around.

- **Phantom Dancer**:
Free damage increase to the entire raid's damage through Mesmerize's similarly named debuff. Can also increase their party's damage by 2% when using Quickstep near a knowledge crystal.

- **Phantom Mystic Knight**:
Free damage increase to the entire raid's damage through Blazing Spellblade's similarly named debuff.

- **Phantom Samurai**: 
Majority of players should be on this phantom job as it's the highest, most consistent DPS phantom job currently available. Using Zeninage in 2 minute bursts along with Iainuki whenever its available. 
Iainuki can also be used in the Hallways and Lockwards sections to have a 10% chance to instantly kill a mob when hit.

### Alliance and Party Set Ups
These lists are more catered to prog-type groups. If you are in reclears or speedrun modes you lists can and will look much more different than these.
Ideally anyone who is not on a main role should be playing a DPS oriented phantom job to help make beating enrages easier.
#### Required
You should have one of these in alliances ABC and 123 due to mechanics that split the raid into two alliances. Back ups are encouraged just in case one perma-dies in prog.
- Phantom Thief (one per side)
- Phantom Geomancer (one per side)
- Phantom Time Mage (one per side)
- Phantom Bard (one per side)
- Phantom Berserker (Only one is required for the whole raid)
#### Strongly Encouraged
These are really, really nice to have to either reduce damage taken, increase the party's damage, increase damage for whole raid, or make the hallways just a little safer.
- Phantom Knight (one per party)
- Phantom Bard (one per party)
- Phantom Chemist (one per party)
- Phantom Ranger (one per side)
- Phantom Dancer (one per whole group)
- Phantom Mystic Knight (one per whole group)
#### If not assigned a key role...
You should be playing Phantom Samurai. It is the easiest and most consistent source of damage due to Iainuki and Zeninage being so powerful.
Phantom Monk is a strong DPS option too! However it suffers from having the 15y kick. If you play Phantom Monk please exercise large amounts of caution when pressing Phantom Kick.

<br/><hr/>
## Preparing for Forked Tower: Blood
Getting ready to enter Forked Tower: Blood requires you to complete a list of objectives before even considering entering the Forked Tower.
1. Complete the "Past and Crescent" quest just past the point of completing the "Calamity Bound" Critical Encounter.
2. Reach Knowledge Level 20
3. Obtain a Sanguine Cipher(s) (purchased with either Silver or Gold pieces) from the Expedition Antiquarian
   - Everyone is **required** to offer a cipher to enter Forked Tower: Blood.
4. Fully level (or "master") a few different Phantom Jobs to fully unlock their kits and gain a few stacks of Phantom Mastery.
   - At a minimum you should master **one** phantom job before attempting Forked Tower.
5. (Optional) Obtain a few pieces of Arcanaut's gear for your preferred role(s).

For a list of phantom jobs to focus on leveling, please consult the image below.

## Entering Forked Tower: Blood
Forked Tower: Blood can only be entered during Auroral Mirages weather. These mirages are a brief 5 minute period in which the South Horn turns an eerie red and the Forked Tower is just barely visible in the North West
corner of the area. Auroral Mirages appear in a random, yet predictable, manner.

:::danger[Documenting Occult Crescent]
Most of this section is here to help document the mechanics of Forked Tower: Blood. While it *could* happen, spontaneous attempts forming in instance are extremely rare.

If you are looking to seriously progress and clear Forked Tower on the N.A. data centers, it is encouraged to join one of the many [Discords](/others/discords) that put together groups.
:::
### Forked Tower: Blood Spawn Mechanics
Under the hood there is a hidden timer. In a fresh, **new instance this timer starts at 5 minutes**. In an existing instance, meaning the first Auroral Mirages has already passed, **the timer begins at 60 minutes** instead.
This timer can also be reduced by completing FATEs and Critical Encounters. 
- Completeing **FATEs (Pots included)** will reduce the timer by 1 minute.
- Completeing **Critical Encounters** will reduce the timer by 5 minutes. 

Once this timer has elapsed, a few more checks are made before the zone switches into Auroral Mirages and opens Forked Tower for recruitment.
1. There are at least 24 people of Knowledge Level 20 in the instance.
2. There are at least 24 people with Forked Tower: Blood unlocked
   - This can be done by progressing past the "Past and Crescent" quest.
3. There are no critical engagement currently recruiting or in progress.
   - If you are in an pre-organized group, do not spawn any critical engagement as you will delay the tower spawning.

If these three conditions are **NOT** met, the timer will 'pause' in its elapsed state until they are all met--which causes the mirages to spawn instantly.

### How to get into Forked Tower: Blood
- 24 unique players must offer Sanguine Ciphers to the reliquary during the Auroral Mirages weather. This weather window only lasts 5 minutes long so please be hasty about inputting your ciphers!
  - **If the 24 unique cipher minimum is met at the 5 minute recruitment period**: the pad will glow even brighter and everyone on the pad, up to a total of 48 people who also offered ciphers, will be teleported into Forked Tower: Blood after roughly 30 more seconds.
- If there are more than 48 ciphers offered, the people who offered enough ciphers to meet the "Offering Threshold" in the Cipher UI will be guaranteed entry.
  -  All other spots, if any remain, will be randomly selected from the people who offered any amount of ciphers.
  - However, if less than 48 ciphers were offered, only those who offered ciphers will be allowed entry into Forked Tower.
- You *must* be on the pavillion when teleportation occurs when given the "Right of Entry" buff to enter the Forked Tower. Else, you will not be teleported into the tower nor will you cipher(s) be refunded.

:::danger[Ciphers Required]
Anyone wishing to enter Forked Tower: Blood **MUST** offer a Sanguine Cipher to the reliquary to be even considered for entry.

**No cipher, no entry**.
:::

### How the Cipher UI Works
In patch 7.3 we were given a brand new UI for the cipher reliquary! Most notably it adds a warning saying that Forked Tower is difficult content and informing players that coordination is *required*. Also there is a mention that entry is not guaranteed along with other statistics about:
- **You have offered:** Amount you of ciphers you've offered.
- **Offering Threshold**: The amount of ciphers in place to guaranteed an entry. You must offer that many ciphers plus one more to be guaranteed entry [Unconfirmed, Logical though]. This concludes we have a TIER based system similar to notoriety for duels.
- **Current Participants:** Number of participants means there's that many unique players offering ciphers.
- **Seeking Passage:** The amount of people who have entered ciphers but do not have a guaranteed entry as they have put in a number of ciphers BELOW the offering threshold (2 in this case).
- **Remaining Places:** Number of spots left that are guaranteed by meeting the offering threshold.
- **Priority Places**: Number of people who have offered enough ciphers to garauntee entry (see the little yellow text below my offer amount).

## Pre-Organized Forked Tower Entry
Players can enter the South Horn in groups of 2-48 players. When entering as a group of 24 or more and assuming everyone meets the conditions listed below--the group will be placed
in a private, locked instance of South Horn. No one can enter this instance for the next 10 minute period or whenever the first Auroral Mirages has passed. This help alleviates any stress a
pre-organized group might have with getting everyone in their group into Forked Tower.
#### Private Instance Requirements
- Group of 24 or larger queueing in together
- 24+ members are Knowledge Level 20 (or higher)
- 24+ members have progressed the quest *"Past and Crescent"* enough to have unlocked Forked Tower: Blood.

### Setting up a Party Finder
It's simple! Use the Party Finder UI under Alliance > Field Operations and set the activity to The Occult Crescent: South Horn! 
From there you can select which party to put yourself in and modify the party compositions by either right clicking to cycle through a normal Full Party (2 tanks, 2 healers, 4 DPS), 
an alliance raid full party (1 tank, 2 healers, 5 DPS), or completely open to any job regardless of role/combat.
If you want to more finely tune a specific party you can left click one and hand select the specific role or jobs for that spot. 
This can be useful in anyprogs or free-for-all password drop runs where everyone rushes to join the party finder first.

#### Party Level Editing
For each individual spot in a party you can pick and choose which role or even down which specific jobs can join. Useful in an anyprog to ensure a 5% stat bonus for each party!

Also you can make spots free (allowing anyone of any job to join it) or completely omit the spot preventing anyone from joining it.

### Reminders Before Joining a Run
Ideally you do these *before* joining a party finder but its always good to stress them again and again...
1. **Make sure you are Knowledge Level 20!**
   - You can confirm this by either talking to Jeffroy in the Phantom Village and asking to confirm level and currencies OR by entering the South Horn solo to check there instead. Both methods work as long as you confirm you are level 20.

    style="cursor:pointer; display: block !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
/>
<p style="text-align:center; margin-top: 0;">(Click to expand in new window)</p>

2. **Ensure you have Ciphers!**
   - As of patch 7.3 anyone who wishes to enter Forked Tower: Blood must offer a Sanguine Cipher to the Reliquary to even be considered a possible entrant. This can be done in the same method by asking Jeffroy or entering South Horn.
3. **Bring Food, Tinctures, and any Arcanaut's gear you can get!**
   - Food is for viatility and extra substats, tinctures is for your openers and other burst windows if allowed, and Arcanaut's gear is just a flat damage increase!

### Once Inside South Horn
The group can feel free to do what they want until the weather changes into mirages--finding chests, getting ciphers, etc... Please just remind people to not die in awkward spots or really just avoid dying at all.
Now is also a great time to check for level 19s if any managed to slip by. You can easily do a mini-gold farm on level 27 mobs in the South West to quick bring them back to level 20 if desired.

:::danger[Ciphers Required]
**Everyone wishing to participate in Forked Tower is required to input a cipher to the reliquary to even be given the chance to enter Forked Tower.** 

There is no more tax evasion or free rides. No cipher, no entry.
:::

:::note[Periodically Check Cipher Statuses]
You should check every so often to ensure people have put their ciphers in. The amount of ciphers offered should equal the number of people currently in instance.

You can see the number of people in your instance through the adventurer list UI.
:::

### Marking Important Players
Each party can use head signs (head markings) to mark important players. This is good for especially phantom chemists so they can recognize each other in the case one dies or
a wipe is happening and you need to chemist cheese to allow another pull.

Commonly it's suggested to
- Mark chemists with attack 1-8
- Mark thiefs and/or rangers for your alliance with an ignore 1-2
