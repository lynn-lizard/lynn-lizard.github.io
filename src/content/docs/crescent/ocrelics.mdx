Introduced in patch 7.25, Phantom Weapons act as Dawntrail's combat relic weapons. These quests (as of writing) include two one time grinds followed by a repeatable
1500 tomestone purchase in between each grind.

## 7.25: Penumbrae Weapons
To start the questline for the Phantom Weapons you must first
1. Complete Dawntrail MSQ (finish the MSQ quest "Dawntrail")
2. Complete the Occult Crescent questline up to Unfamiliar Territory
From this point you can speak to Lydirceil in the Phantom Village to begin your first one-time grind.
### One-Time Grind: Demiatmas
To complete this quest you need to gather three of each of six different Demiatmas types. These Demiarmas can be earned by completing FATEs with a gold rating in certain Dawntrail zones
or from FATEs and Critical Engagements (CEs) inside the South Horn. Each region of the South Horn provides a different type of Demiatma to obtain.

:::tip[Demiatma Drop Rates]
It was revealed in LiveLetter LXXXVII that the drop rates for the demiatmas are currently:
- **FATEs**: 5% chance
- **CEs**: 20% chance
:::
One you have obtains three of each type of demiatma, return to the Phantom Village and speak with Gerolt. From there the player can trade the uncapped level 100 tomestones
for Arcanite; three of which are required to exchanged for you shiny new Penumbrae weapon.
