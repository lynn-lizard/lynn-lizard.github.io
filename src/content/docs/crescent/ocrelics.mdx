Introduced in patch 7.25, Phantom Weapons act as Dawntrail's combat relic weapons. These quests (as of writing) include two one time grinds followed by a repeatable
1500 tomestone purchase in between each grind.

## 7.25: Penumbrae Weapons
To start the questline for the Phantom Weapons you must first
1. Complete Dawntrail MSQ (finish the MSQ quest "Dawntrail")
2. Complete the Occult Crescent questline up to Unfamiliar Territory
From this point you can speak to Lydirceil in the Phantom Village to begin your first one-time grind.
### One-Time Grind: Demiatmas
To complete this quest you need to gather three of each of six different Demiatmas types. These Demiarmas can be earned by completing FATEs with a gold rating in certain Dawntrail zones
or from FATEs and Critical Engagements (CEs) inside the South Horn. Each region of the South Horn provides a different type of Demiatma to obtain.

:::tip[Demiatma Drop Rates]
It was revealed in LiveLetter LXXXVII that the drop rates for the demiatmas are currently:
- **FATEs**: 5% chance
- **CEs**: 20% chance
:::
One you have obtains three of each type of the six demiatma, return to the Phantom Village and speak with Gerolt. From there the player can trade 500 uncapped level 100 tomestones
for one *Arcanite;* three (1500 tomes total) of which are required to exchanged for you shiny new Penumbrae weapon. In total this step costs 31,500 tomes.

## 7.31: Umbrae Weapons
To start this quest return to the Phantom Village and talk to Gerolt. They will task you with obtaining a handful of items from various places in Dawntrail zones. Specifically:
1. Rroneek Glue Block from a vendor in Tuliyollal at (13.1, 12.7). It costs 300,000 gil.
2. Ut'ohmu Siderite from the Bicolor Gem vendor in Yak T'el or either one in Tuliyollal/Solution 9 for 600 Bicolor Gems (38 FATEs w/ no bonus)
3. One Synthetic Dark Matter Alpha, Beta, AND Gamma each. These need to be crafted by you or a friend.

:::caution[Marketboarding Items]
All the above items can be bought off the Marketboards as well. However, prices can vary wildly and you should not buy the Rroneek Glue off the markets unless at a steep discount.
:::

Once all items are gathered, return to the Phantom Village to start the Aether, Aether Everywhere quest. This will begin the next lengthy one-time grind.

### One-Time Grind: The Aetherwells
This step requires you to fill up Aetherwells to 10,000 points per each. There are four wells in total: Green, Blue, Red, and Yellow. Each well is filled by completing a specific Duty Roulette type in Duty Finder. 
- Green: High-level Dungeons
- Blue: Alliance Raids
- Red: Trials
- Yellow: Normal Raids

When finishing a duty in the roulette, each duty will give you an amount of points based on which duty was completed for that Aetherwell. The point value of each duty was documented and can be found

:::tip[Daily Bonuses!]
There is a daily bonus for completing at least one roulette a day. Eligability for the bonus does reset along with the daily reset.

Each bonus is worth:
- Trials/Normal Raid: 614 points
- High Level Dungeons: 376 points
- Alliance Raid: 101 points

:::danger[Progress Only Through Roulettes...]
Depsite this being the relic quest for Phantom Weapons: **No progress can be made on this step through Occult Crescent.**

When the Aetherwells step is completed, return to the Phantom Village and speak to Gerolt. From there the player can trade 500 uncapped level 100 tomestones
for one *Waxing Arcanite;* three of which (1500 tomes total), along with your Penumbrae weapon of choice, are required to exchanged for you shiny new Umbrae weapon. In total this step costs 31,500 tomes.
