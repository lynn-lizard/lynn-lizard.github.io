Occult Crescent was released in 7.25 is Dawntrail's featured Field Operation similar to the likes of Eureka and Bozja. You will explore the island known as Shades' Triangle which takes inspiration from
the legend of the real-world Bermueda Triangle. Occult Crescent draws parallels from the myths that many ships and explorers alike seem to go missing out of thin air but with the added notion of 
treasure and glory to be earned from conquering the Triangle.

Currently, to enter Occult Crescent you must have completed the questline start with "One Last Hurrah" (starts in Tuliyollal (X:17.1, Y:11.8)) up to Umfamiliar Territory to unlock the South Horn. You must also be
on a combat job and have a minimum item level of 690. Occult Crescent does sync item levels to 700 as a note! So any materia on gear above i700 will be completely disabled. This is
important for later when talking about the Field Op's gear progression.

## Phantom Jobs
While exploring the Occult Crescent you can equip various Phantom Jobs that will augment your playstyle in supportive, defensive, or offense ways.
There are currently 13 available phantom jobs to level and master, each with their own gimmick. With future patches (7.45 and 7.55) more Phantom Jobs will become available to the player.

To learn more about the different phantom jobs, please visit the page dedicated to it [here](/crescent/pjobs/)

## In-Zone Leveling
Similar to Eureka/Bozja there is a separate leveling system, two this time actually. 

There is your <u>Knowledge Level</u> acting as your overall, more general experience level gained from completing
FATEs, Critical Engagements, and even chaining together mob kills at and/or around your or your party's overall level. This currently goes maxes out at 20 and only affects what mobs will or will not
be aggressive when being near them. Your knowledge level also dictates which mobs are chainable by your party. If you wish to chain but your party's levels are all over the place, the party leader can choose
to sync everyone's levels; allow chaining to be possible.

And there is a <u>Phantom Job Level</u> which is specific to the phantom job
you currently have equipped. Leveling phantom jobs will not only unlock or upgrade your phantom actions but fully leveling, or "mastering", a phantom job will grant you a stacking mastery bonus for every mastered
phantom job. This mastery bonus will increase both your damage and healing potency by 2% for each stack.

<br></br>
<hr></hr>
## FATEs and CEs
Occult also draws parallels to Bozja in that there are smaller, faster encounters using the FATE system and then larger, more intense battles through Critical Engagements (CEs). It further mixes Eureka and Bozja
together by allowing certain CEs to be "prepped" by killing a specific mob on the off chance it spawns an encounter. Currently, the CEs are mixed in that some spawn overtime and others spawn by prepping.

## Mob Chaining
Mob Chaining returns in Occult Crescent. Chaining is when you kill mobs of a certain level within a window of time between each kill. The window of time shrinking as the chain grows longer, but the rewards
improving the higher your chain goes. Currently, to chain mobs you must kill mobs higher than your party's average level. The level of mob required going up with each additional party member. This caps around 
7 or 8 levels higher when you reach an 8-member party. Currently, chaining only rewards Enlightenment Gold Pieces, Knowledge Level XP, and Phantom Job XP.

| Party Size    | Enemy Level |
| :----------:  | :-----------: |
| Solo          | 2 levels above |
| 2             | 3 levels above |
| 3-4           | 4-5 levels above |

| 7-8           | 7-8 levels above |
</div>

## Currencies in Occult Crescent
There are currently 3 different types of currency that are all earned in (mostly) unique ways and change be exchanged for mounts, glamours, gear progression, ciphers for forked tower, or
other resources to aide you in taking on the Crescent. There is silver which is only from FATEs, CEs, and Bunnys/Pots. Gold which can only be earned from chaining mobs or Bunnys/Pots. Then Sanguinite which is
the Forked Tower: Blood exclusive currency (similar to Eurekan Fragments from Baldesian).

## Treasure Coffers
Around Occult Crescent you will find randomly coffers spread around the various landscapes. These coffers come in two varities: Bronze and Silver. 
Both contain mounts, hairstyles, materia, party favors, materials required for gear progression, and so much more.
These are spawned in by doing things such as completing FATEs, CEs, clearing Forked Tower: Blood (South Horn Specific), and earning gold pieces from killed mobs.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Activity | Bronze Spawn % | Silver Spawn % | 
| :------------: | :-----------: | :----------:
| FATEs     | 75%       | 7.5% |
| CEs       | 100%      | 7.5% |
| Chaining  | 10%       | 1%   |
| FT: Blood | 2 always  | 1 spawns, 10% for another |
</div>


:::note[Coffer Drop Rates]
You can visit <a href="https://gacha.infi.ovh/occult/?territory=1&coffer=1596" target="_blank">Infi's Gacha Website</a> to see what items can drop from both kinds of coffers and how rare each item is from
their respective coffer.
:::

<br></br>
<hr></hr>
## Persistent Pots
Similar to Eureka Bunnies, the Persistent and Pleading Pots FATEs, that when completed succesfully, will grant you extra special rewards if you are lucky to obtain a magical elixir. Using the elixir and
ensuring the Persistent Pot companion you just obtained does not die, the pot will guide around to a hidden coffer. These coffers are either bronze, silver and gold. Each one rarer than the last but containing
more and more rewards. As of 7.3, pots will now give both enlightenment silver and gold pieces from opening their coffers. 
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Coffer | Spawn % | Currency Rewards |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Bronze | 50% | 100 silver, 160 gold |
| Silver | 40% | 300 silver, 480 gold |
| Gold | 10% | 1000 silver, 1600 gold |
</div>

On rare occasions (~10% of the time), the pot companion will stick around and will offer to take you to *another* hidden coffer. You should take them up on this offer because these 
"double ups" will **always** garauntee a gold coffer.

their respective coffer.

## Fortune Carrots
The Happy Bunnies do make a grand return in the form of Fortune Carrots. Sometimes when exploring around Occult Crescent you will run across a half-eaten, glowing carrot on the ground.
If you are so lucky enough to have a Fortune Carrot item in your inventory, you can use this near said floor-carrot to spawn a Happy Bunny who will thank you with a golden coffer!
This coffer contains materia, 1,000 Enlightenment Silver Pieces, and 1,600 Enlightenment Gold Pieces.

Currently, Fortune Carrots *only* drop from the random bronze coffers that appear around
Occult Crescent, from Persistent Pot coffers, or you could get refunded a carrot from the bunny coffer you just opened!

## Gearing
Each Field Op features a brand new armor set that has it's own unique set of effects specific for that zone. This time we have the ilvl 745 armor called Arcanaut's 
Gear which features a main stat bonuses and a stat called "Special Attribute". 

:::note[What is Special Attribute?]
This "Special Attribute" stat increases phantom job action damage by ~1% for every point you have equipped, 
currently maxing out around +15 in total with a full set of Arcanaut's +2 gear. 
:::

You can purchase all 7 sets of Arcanaut's gear from the Expedition Antiquarian in Base Camp for 4,000 Enlightened Silver pieces for each separate armor piece. 
This armor can also be upgraded at the Expedition Armorer to increase the amount of bonus main stat and special attribute given.

:::danger[Melding Arcanaut's Gear]
Arcanaut's gear can be melded but the melds will not work inside the South Horn since the zone syncs your item level to 700. 
This will, similar to all cases of item level syncing in FFXIV, disables any materia in gear that is greater than the ilvl sync of an instance/zone. 
However any pieces at or below i700 (such as Neo-Kingdom accessories) still allow their materia to function as normal. 
Many Best in Slots sets will feature these pieces so make sure you keep up on your daily/weekly hunts!
:::

### Upgrading Arcanaut's Gear
For now, you can purchase upgrade materials from Expedition Antiquarian for both silver, gold and the Forked Tower: Blood exclusive Sanguinite. 

Each upgrade increases the main stat by +40 and grants one point of special attirbute each. Below is a list of required materials you must present, 
along with the armor piece itself, to the Expedition Armorer in Base Camp.

To upgrade a piece from base to +1 you need...
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Item | Amount | Cost |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Base Arcanut's | 1 | 4,000 silver |
| Aetherspun Silver | 3 | 3,600 silver |
| Aetherial Fixative | 3 | 4,800 gold |
</div>

To upgrade a piece from +1 to +2 you need...
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Item | Amount | Cost |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Arcanaut's +1 | 1 | See above table |
| Aetherspun Gold | 3 | Random Coffer Drop|
| X-Fixative | 6 | 60 Sanguinite |
</div>

<details>
<summary>Open to see costs for a singular full set and all 7 sets</summary>
In total each set will run you...
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Item/Currency | Amount |
| :--: | :--: |
| Silver | 38,000 |
| Gold | 24,000 |
| Aetherspun Gold | 15 |
| Sanguinite | 300 |
</div>

All 7 sets costs...
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Item/Currency | Amount |
| :--: | :--: |
| Silver | 266,000 |
| Gold | 168,000 |
| Aetherspun Gold | 105 |
| Sanguinite | 2100 |
</div>
</details>

### Best in Slot
Best in slot of Occult Crescent is maximizing the amount of Special Attibute you have. This is currently achieved by wearing a full set of Arcanaut's gear and augmenting it to the +2 version. 
At max, you should have an extra 600 main stat and 15 special attribute or ~15% more damage on phantom actions. Some best in slots will also feature various pieces of Neo-Kingdom gear as its
item level sits right at 700. Allowing materia to be melded and active while inside Occult Crescent. Any non-Neo Kingdom pieces can be substituted for an item of similar substats (Ex: two
different rings both with Crit AND Determination)
:::caution[Is Best In Slot Required?]
**No.** 

Having a perfectly made best in slot set is NOT required to do anything in Occult Crescent or progress in Forked Tower. Some Forked Tower groups may *ask* for an amount of gear, but its only to help make
DPS checks a little more lenient for the whole group.
