Occult Crescent was released in 7.25 is Dawntrail's featured Field Operation similar to the likes of Eureka and Bozja. You will explore the island known as Shades' Triangle which takes inspiration from
the legend of the real-world Bermueda Triangle.

Currently, to enter Occult Crescent you must have completed the questline start with "One Last Hurrah" (starts in Tuliyollal (X:17.1, Y:11.8)) up to Umfamiliar Territory to unlock the South Horn. You must also be
on a combat job and have a minimum item level of 690. Occult Crescent does sync item levels to 700 as a note! So any materia on gear above i700 will be completely disabled. This is
important for later when talking about the Field Op's gear progression.

## Phantom Jobs
While exploring the Occult Crescent you can equip various Phantom Jobs that will augment your playstyle in supportive, defensive, and/or offense ways.
There are currently 15 available phantom jobs to level and master, each with their own gimmick. With future patches (7.55) more Phantom Jobs will become available to us.

To learn more about the different phantom jobs, please visit the page dedicated to it [Phantom Jobs page](/crescent/pjobs/)

<br/><hr/>

## Leveling
Similar to Eureka/Bozja there is an entirely different leveling system. This time there are two: Knowledge Level and Phantom Job Level.

### Knowledge Level
<u>Knowledge Level</u> acts as your overall, more general experience level. Knowledge level experience is earned from completing
FATEs, Critical Engagements, and chaining together mob kills at or above your or your party's overall level. 

Knowledge level currently caps at 20 and affects the following things: 
1. what mobs will or will not be aggressive when being near them. 
2. How much damage you will take/recieve from mobs of a higher/level lower.
3. Dictates which mobs are "chainable".

If you wish to chain but your party member's levels are uneven, the party leader can choose to sync everyone's levels; allow chaining to be possible.

:::danger[Incapacitation Penality]
If you are above level 5, dying and returning or leaving the instance without being revived or will cause a loss in knowledge level exp. Your knowledge
level can decrease this way. The amount of knowledge exp lost is based on your level.

Always shout for a raise if you can!
:::

#### Knowledge Level v. Mob Level - Damage Taken/Recieved
Below is a chart that goes over how much damage you take and do to mobs of a certain level above your own as well as how that correlates to party size.
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Mob Level | Damage Done   | Damage Taken | Party Size |
| :------:  | :-------: | :-----: | :------: |
| +0 | 100% | 100% |
| +1 | 100% | 105% |
| +2 | 95% | 115% | Solo
| +3 | 55% | 450% | 2 players
| +4 | 35% | 1100% | 3-4 players
| +5 | 33% | 1200% | 3-4 players
| +6 | 24% | 1900% | 5-6 players
| +7 | 19% | 2000% | 5-8 players
| +8 | 16% | 2200% | 7-8 players
| +9 | 10% | 2500% |
| +10 | 6% | 3000% |
| +11 | 4% | 3500% |
| +12 | 2% | 4000% |
| >=13 | 1% | 4000% |
</div>

### Phantom Job Level
<u>Phantom Job Level</u> is specific to the phantom job you currently have equipped. Phantom job experience can be earned from completing
FATEs, Critical Engagements, and chaining together mob kills at or above your or your party's overall level.

Leveling phantom jobs will not only unlock or upgrade your phantom actions but fully leveling, or "mastering", a phantom job will grant you a stacking mastery bonus for every mastered
phantom job. This mastery bonus will increase both your damage and healing potency by 2% for each stack.

<br/><hr/>
## Gear Progression
This Field Op we are currently able to obtain Arcanaut's gear and Occult Accessories. Both of these help you grow more powerful through stacking Special Attribute and bonus main stat (str, dex, mind, etc.) on those pieces
of gear.

Arcanaut's gear is purchased with silver and occult accessories can be rarely found when completeting critical encounters, opening coffers,
finding gold pot chests, and fortune carrot chests.

To read more about gearing, please [visit the page all about gearing](/crescent/gearing)

<br/><hr/>
## FATEs and CEs
Occult also draws parallels to Bozja in that there are smaller, faster encounters using the FATE system and then larger, more intense battles through Critical Encounters (CEs). It further mixes Eureka and Bozja
together by allowing certain CEs to be spawned, or "prepped", by killing a specific mobs to spawns specific Critical Encounters. Currently, CEs are mixed in that some automatically spawn and others spawn by players prepping mobs.

FATEs and CEs can be found on your map in either blue (FATEs) or red (CEs) circles. A chime will play when a CE spawns as well.

What's important to note is that your Knowledge/Phantom Job level does **NOT** matter when participating in FATES and CEs. Anyone of any level can join and reap full rewards that scale to their knowledge level.

### Joining FATEs and CEs
To join a FATE simply walk up and engage with the FATE boss present. 

To join a Critical Encounter you must walk to the designated area and stand in the glowing blue circle. After a 3 minute
recruitment period the CE will place everyone present into the encounter and begin combat.

- [South Horn FATEs](/crescent/southhorn#FATEs)

<br/><hr/>
## Mobs and Chaining
Mob Chaining returns in Occult Crescent. Chaining is when you kill mobs of a certain level within a window of time between each kill. The window of time shrinking as the chain grows longer, but the rewards
improving the higher your chain goes. Currently, to chain mobs you must kill mobs higher than your party's average level. The level of mob required going up with each additional party member. This caps around 
7 or 8 levels higher when you reach an 8-member party. Currently, chaining only rewards Enlightenment Gold Pieces, Knowledge Level XP, and Phantom Job XP.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Party Size    | Enemy Level |
| :----------:  | :-----------: |
| Solo          | 2 levels above |
| 2             | 3 levels above |
| 3-4           | 4-5 levels above |
| 5-6           | 6-7 levels above |
| 7-8           | 7-8 levels above |
</div>

:::tip[Mob Credit]
Kill credit and rewards for mobs is only given to the party/person who attacks or aggros the mob first.

<br/><hr/>
## Treasure Coffers
Around Occult Crescent you will find randomly coffers spread around the Occult Crescent. These coffers come in two varities: Bronze and Silver. 
Both contain mounts, hairstyles, materia, party favors, materials required for gear progression, and so much more.
These are spawned in by doing things such as completing FATEs, CEs, clearing Forked Tower: Blood (South Horn Specific), and earning gold pieces from killed mobs.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Activity | Bronze Spawn % | Silver Spawn % | 
| :------------: | :-----------: | :----------:
| FATEs     | 75%       | 7.5% |
| CEs       | 100%      | 10% |
| Chaining  | 10%       | 1%   |
| Forked Tower: Blood | 2 spawn  | 1 spawns, 10% for another |
</div>

In total, you can have 8 silvers and 30 bronzes spawned at one time. You can check the number of coffers currently available by using Phantom Freelancer's *Occult Treasuresight* anywhere while in Occult Crescent.
Upon use you will be given an echo message stating how many silvers and bronzes are currently spawned, no locations are given.

Example: `You sense the presence of 1 silver coffer and 9 bronze coffers in the area!`

their respective coffer.

### Bronze/Silver Coffer Locations
Map showcases all possible spawn locations for the 8 silvers and 60 bronze locations. All bronze locations have an equal chance of spawning.

### Coffer Farming Routes
For pre-made farming routes in South Horn, you can visit the [South Horn page's chest farming section](/crescent/southhorn#chest-farming).


<br/><hr/>
## Persistent Pots
Similar to Eureka Bunnies, the Persistent and Pleading Pots FATEs, that when completed succesfully, will grant you extra special rewards if you are lucky to obtain a magical elixir. Using the elixir and
ensuring the Persistent Pot companion you just obtained does not die, the pot will guide around to a hidden coffer. These coffers are either bronze, silver and gold. Each one rarer than the last but containing
more and more rewards. As of 7.3, pots will now give both enlightenment silver and gold pieces from opening their coffers. 
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| Coffer | Spawn % | Currency Rewards |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Bronze | 50% | 100 silver, 160 gold |
| Silver | 40% | 300 silver, 480 gold |
| Gold | 10% | 1000 silver, 1600 gold |
</div>

On rare occasions (~10% of the time), the pot companion will stick around and will offer to take you to *another* hidden coffer. You should take them up on this offer because these 
"double ups" will **always** garauntee a gold coffer.

their respective coffer.

### Pot Chest Locations
Below is a map showcasing all potential pot locations. There are 80 chest locations in total, 30 for the North FATE and 30 for the South FATE; both of which are denoted with a golden chest icon. 
The remaining 20 are for second chance pots; these are noted by the more bronze coffer icon.

### Quick Pots Map
Based on which Pot FATE you just completed (north left, south right), you can immediately use your Magical Elixir and get an immediate sense on where your pot might take you! Simply match the color of 
dots with the initial direction, and you can garauntee that your pot will take you to one of those similarly colored dots. 

Example: Finishing the North pots FATE (using the left image) and sensing something East means I can head towards the group of pink dots, stand in the center of the pink dots, use my elixir once again, and almost immediately know where my pot chest is!

## Fortune Carrots
Very rarely you can obtain Fortune Carrots from Bronze/Silver coffers and any rarity of pot chest. 

To redeem a Fortune Carrot, you must find and stand near a half-eaten ground carrot that are in random, pre-determined spots throughout Occult Crescent.
Upon use, a Happy Bunny will appear and reward you with a gold chest. This chest contains 1000 silver, 1600 gold, 200k gil, and an assortment of other rare items.

### How Carrot Spawns Work
- 2 Carrots can be on the map at a time at random, pre-determined spots
  - These are per-instance, so you can leave instance and join a new one to get completely different carrot spots
- These 2 carrots are visible by all players
  - Light competition as anyone can visit a carrot spot and use it
- If a player uses a carrot another will instantly respawn in a spot where there is not a carrot
  - This includes the spot where a carrot *just* was (meaning you can chain together multiple - <a href="https://youtu.be/1P76wrOBgkc" target="_blank">Video of a carrot chain</a>)
