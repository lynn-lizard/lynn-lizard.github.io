## Critical Engagements
Critical Engagements, or CEs from here on, are the older sibling to FATEs. These battles are against a much more fierce foe and can sometimes reward new Phantom Jobs, field records, as well as more experience and silver.
CEs are broken in two kinds, ones that can be spawned by the player and ones that spawn randomly without player input. The rewards are the same regardless of spawn method however.

Every successful Critical Engagement will reward the following
 - 200-23,400 Knowledge XP (scales to your knowledge level)
 - 480 Phantom Job XP
 - 20 uncapped tomestones
 - 10 weekly capped tomestones
 - 200 enlightenment silver pieces
 - 20% for a Demiatma (which demiatma dropping is zone dependent)
 - Field Notes (specified below)
### Randomly Spawning CEs
These CEs will spawn randomly over time. These have a ~120 minute (2 hours) cooldown period before a specific CE can spawn again.

## FATEs
These are just like FATEs in the overworld. Just show up, do the required objective, and move on. 
These are much smaller in scale compared to the critical engagement counterpart and often only take a fraction of the time to complete. 
There are no knowledge level or phantom job level requires to participate in any FATEs around Occult Crescent. Just show up and fight!

Every successful FATE you complete with a **gold** rating will reward the following
- 40-4,680 Knowledge XP (scales to your knowledge level)
- 80 Phantom Job XP
- 30 enlightenment silver pieces
- 5% chance for a Demiatma (which demiatma dropping is zone dependent)
