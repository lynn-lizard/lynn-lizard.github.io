While information is here and accurate enough to be deployed, the page is not yet totally completed. Please check back later to see a fully completed page!

This is the first zone of the Occult Crescent released in patch 7.25 and contains many FATEs, Critical Engagements, and the Forked Tower: Blood. This zone also contains the first half of the
story. Completion of the story is not gated by clear the Forked Tower: Blood.

## Mobs
Mobs of varying species and types can be found in clusters around the South Horn. Generally the further you go from base camp, the higher the level of mob you will encounter. 

You can find a non-exhaustive list of mobs along with their aggro type and resistance's on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWuDtRxYUsVo2HxzvUecnzXpyRo1ozxuw_s6Lr2gepU/edit?gid=2005261057#gid=2005261057" target="_blank">Do It Doom</a>

## Critical Encounters
Critical Encounters, or CEs from here on, are the older sibling to FATEs. These battles are against a much more fierce foe and can sometimes reward new Phantom Jobs, field records, as well as more experience and silver.
CEs are broken in two kinds, ones that can be spawned by the player and ones that spawn randomly without player input. The rewards are the same regardless of spawn method however.

Every successful Critical Engagement will reward the following
 - 200-23,400 Knowledge XP (scales to your knowledge level)
 - 480 Phantom Job XP
 - 20 uncapped tomestones
 - 10 weekly capped tomestones
 - 200 enlightenment silver pieces
 - 20% for a Demiatma (which demiatma dropping is zone dependent)
 - Field Notes (specified below)

### Randomly Spawning CEs
These CEs will spawn randomly over time. These have a ~120 minute (2 hours) cooldown period before a specific CE can spawn again.
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| CE | Boss | Noteable Drops |
| :---: | :---: | :--: |
| Company of Stone        | Stone Men         | n/a |

| Flames of Dusk          | Hinkypunk         | n/a |
</div>

### Player Spawned CEs
All CEs listed below are spawned by killing a specific mob until it spawns. If it doesn't spawn, keep trying! These have a ~60 minute (1 hour) cooldown period before a specific CE can spawn again.
<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| CE | Boss | Spawn Mob | Mob Location | Noteable Drops |
| :---: | :---: | :--: | :--: |  :--: |

</div>

<br/><hr/>
## FATEs
These are just like FATEs in the overworld. Just show up, do the required objective, and move on. 
These are much smaller in scale compared to the critical engagement counterpart and often only take a fraction of the time to complete. 
There are no knowledge level or phantom job level requires to participate in any FATEs around Occult Crescent. Just show up and fight!

Every successful FATE you complete with a **gold** rating will reward the following
- 40-4,680 Knowledge XP (scales to your knowledge level)
- 80 Phantom Job XP
- 30 enlightenment silver pieces
- 5% chance for a Demiatma (which demiatma dropping is zone dependent)

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
| FATE | Location | Noteable Drops |
| :---: | :---: | :--: |
| A Delicate Balance    | (X: 14, Y: 34) |

| Pleading Pots         | (X: 25, Y: 17) | Field Notes |
| Persistent Pots       | (X: 11, Y: 32) | Field Notes |
</div>

<br/><hr/>
## Gold Farming
Gold farming is primarily done with the use of thief tanks, thief sages, and cannoneers to kill groups of high level mobs before they overwhelm the group. Most groups tend to use the top floor of The Abanonded Ascent tower located in the
bottom left (South West) corner of the map. They would go in circles gathering and killing the Isleblazers and Zirnitras until satisfied. 

You can read more about gold farming in the following Google doc:

## Chest Farming
Farming chests efficiently can help you not overcap and waste chest spawns. Here are a few pre-made routes used by friends and myself.

### Multiple Lines Routing
Useful for doing specific sections of the map at a time. Allows you to take breaks and change what routes you do depending on time.

    style="cursor:pointer; display: block !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
/>

### No Return Routing
Don't want to press return and just get the whole map in one sweep? Use this routing.

## South Horn Persistent Pots
### Pot Chest Locations
Below is a map showcasing all potential pot locations. There are 80 chest locations in total, 30 for the North FATE and 30 for the South FATE; both of which are denoted with a golden chest icon. 
The remaining 20 are for second chance pots; these are noted by the more bronze coffer icon.

/>
<p style="text-align:center; margin-top: 0;">(Click to expand in new window)</p>

### Finding your Pot Chest Fast
Based on which Pot FATE you just completed (north left, south right), you can immediately use your Magical Elixir and get an immediate sense on where your pot might take you! Simply match the color of 
dots with the initial direction, and you can garauntee that your pot will take you to one of those similarly colored dots. 

Example: Finishing the North pots FATE (using the left image) and sensing something East means I can head towards the group of pink dots, stand in the center of the pink dots, use my elixir once again, and almost immediately know where my pot chest is!
