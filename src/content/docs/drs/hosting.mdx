### Hosting a DRS run
Before even starting this... going to a lot of DRS runs, listening to how different people host/call their own runs, and asking questions will all help you 
A LOT when first learning to host. Once you feel ready, The following page will help you know what you should do in order to learn how to both prepare for and actually host a DRS run.

### Before Hosting
Before even putting up a run here are a couple things you can do to make things a bit easier for yourself.
- Learn to call by shadowcalling - Go to runs and either join a different VC or deafen yourself instead of listening to the host and call things out for yourself as practice. This way you have less pressure as the only person you are killing is yourself if you make any miscalls.
    - The advantage of going to a separate VC is that if you have a couple vets join you, they can notice and help offer advice for any mistakes.
    - If you are planning to host an anyprog, figure out how you are going to explain mechanics in a short and susinct manner. Personally I just use the /guide commands and go down each picture explaining it, but everyone has their own way (once again this is where listening to others explain fights comes in handy).
    - Here are [timelines of the fights](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eEqYagB2WPvrsWN8LXmLIjsUDWINL7dvBLn7LqMWXcc/edit#heading=h.wz1yzggpgo05>) that you can study.
- Choose a type of run to host, you will need slightly different resources depending on the type of run.
    - [Anyprog Recruitment post](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc3FqGgYsuuU3CEOlYDAOPWlKwUQAZfwhI9HyGhNSfY/edit?usp=sharing>) and [Holsters](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FSUu_NM2-OV_nR7CU1GlgrqYwdR46foryK7OXXXngfY/edit?gid=2084095906#gid=2084095906>)

### Pre Run
Once you have finished recruitment, here are some things you should go over in VC before zoning into the instance.
- Assign Roles - Here is a [helpful spreadsheet](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxC1DANJQIOUh-TnFBaOHiGm-NwyDM7iDJ9h6wlySmQ/edit?usp=sharing>) that you can fill out and just copy/paste from for a quick roster
    - Duelist
    - Main Tank
    - 4 Percepts (Slimes, Golems, TA, Mino)
    - 2 Rends
    - Banish
    - Mimic Batteries
- Optional Roles
    - Shubbles (if not using AS)
    - Mino Incense (if only 3 tanks)
- Go Over Holsters
    - [Anyprog Holsters](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FSUu_NM2-OV_nR7CU1GlgrqYwdR46foryK7OXXXngfY/edit?gid=2084095906#gid=2084095906>)
    - [Reclear Holsters](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wlm-oVFsV3kxt9xdf8mK9HrcFP62DDYuGYT443JbVI/edit?gid=1631819016#gid=1631819016>)
<br /><hr />

### Slimes
If you are in a 48/48 alliance here is how you should assign people for slimes:
- 4 tanks and 4 healers - one per room for green slimes
 - Tanks will pull the first 5 slimes and their Healer will pull the last one via the standard  “3, 2, 1 method”
- 2 people (any role) to handle North/South soldier each
- Everyone extra splits up evenly in each room to kill red slimes - you can have one or two of these people percept traps

#### Lowman
**Remember to do Lowman Organization at the box in order to properly slot in needed actions.**
If you need to do Lowman Organization here is how you should assign people:
- 4 tanks one per room for green slimes
    - Tanks will pull all slimes they need via 3, 2, 1 method
    - These tanks can be DPS they would just drop down with Incense/Mimic Slotted instead of their normal dps actions and mimic back said actions at Trinity Seeker
- 4 people one per room to pull red slimes to the Burst/Rampager in the hallway - you can have one or two of these people percept traps
- 2 people for North/South soldier with Burst/Rampage in order to interrupt the red slime fusion casts.
    - Rampage/Burst is used solely for the aoe interrupt, not for damage. You can hold all of the red slimes alive in the north/south only using it to keep them from fusing into a dangerous big red, and also keeping more reds from dropping.

:::tip[Tank Stances]
- Remind tanks to turn on their tank stances! Delubrum is a level synced instance so any buffs or stances are removed upon entry.
:::
<br /><hr />


### Golems
If you are in a 48/48 alliance here is how you should assign people for Golems:
- 4 tanks (one per golem)
- 3 healers (one for each of the non red golem tanks)
- 1 ranged dps on red golem to help interrupt for the red tank (if they need it)
- 2 people (any role) to tank North/South Hallway Golems
- 1 person to percept (can be anyone)
- Everyone else kills the golems in the order Blue > White > Green > Red

#### Lowman
**Remember to do Lowman Organization at the box in order to properly slot in needed actions.**
If you need to do Lowman Organization here is how you should assign people:
- Pull 2 people from Slimes side to go golems so the splits are 10 on slimes and 14+ on golems
- 4 actual tanks if you can, minimum needed is 2 (for the initial blue golems)
    - Have the blue golem tanks pop a Medikit at the box so no Esuna is required
    - If you can't get actual tanks you can have phys ranged tank the green golems with proper support (Prot, Bubble, Potion Kit), they will interrupt all metamorphose casts until the actual tanks on both blue golems are free to take the green golems off the phys ranged.
- 1 caster to pull and sleep the North/South Hallway Golems
- 1 person to percept (can be anyone)
- Everyone else kills the golems in the order Blue > Green > White > Red
    - Kill order is different as this helps with dpsing the white golem down before it casts Compaction fully healing itself

:::tip[Tank Stances]
- Remind tanks to turn on their tank stances! Delubrum is a level synced instance so any buffs or stances are removed upon entry.

<br /><hr />

### Trinity Seeker
- If you are hosting an anyprog this is where you can go over more about LB3, the AFK timer, and when to use Actions
- Mark the Main Tank
    - +2 OTs for stack buster if MT isn’t comfortable solo

:::tip[Orient your calls ]
 - Let the raid know how you plan to direct your calls. The most common ways are True North or Boss Relative. Letting people know how you call will save lives. 
:::
<br /><hr />

### Queens Guard
- Mark a Main and Off Tank
    - Pick Mids/Walls (Knight/Gunner mid, Warrior/Soldier wall)
- Go over Healer reflect spots
- Get a Dispeller (if needed)
<br /><hr />

### Trinity Avowed
- Have tanks put on Shell and Aethershield (or shubblers hand out shell/bubble if not using AS)
- Reminders about forced march moving two squares.
- Reminders about how brands work
<br /><hr />

### Stygimoloch Lord
- 4 Tanks for minotaurs
    - Off tanks if requested for sweeps
- Healers to B/D
    - B for Beflect, D for Dispel
<br /><hr />

### Queen
- Have tanks put on Shell and Aethershield (or shubblers hand out shell/bubble if not using AS)
- Main Tank
    - Prefer to get a solo Pure Invuln tank that knows the Blood Rage invuln trick or has Font of Skill in their holster
    - Otherwise have 3 Tanks w/ Pure Invuln take the busters
    - If not enough pure invuln tanks, assign 3 tanks to invuln the buster and have healer(s) be ready to esuna doom off of the tanks without a pure invuln and have the next tank provoke after the current tank takes both hits.
