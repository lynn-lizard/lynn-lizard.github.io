### What is Delubrum Reginae Savage? ###
Delubrum Reginae (Savage) is a difficult large-scale 24-48 person raid that came out during the Shadowbringers expansion. This raid acted as the Bozja equivalent to Baldesian Arsenal.
Inside you will face off against 4 enraging fights with some simpler trash fights inbetween each. 

You will be expected to be using Lost Actions and Pure Essences as they are vital to clearing
the raid.
