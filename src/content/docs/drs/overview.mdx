### What is Delubrum Reginae Savage? ###
Delubrum Reginae (Savage) is a difficult large-scale 24-48 person raid that acts as the Shadowbringers' equivalent to Baldesion Arsenal.
Inside you will face off against 4 enraging bosses with some simpler fights between them. 

You will be expected to be using Lost Actions and Pure Essences as they are vital to clearing
the raid. Not bringing the proper actions, essences, and reraisers will often result in you being kicked from the current run.
